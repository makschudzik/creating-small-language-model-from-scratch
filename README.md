# creating-small-language-model-from-scratch
This project implements a simple, neural network-based Language Model entirely **from scratch** using the PyTorch library. Its main goal is to demonstrate key concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning mechanisms in a practical and accessible way.
